## Brief Description

### Telegraf

Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems, and IoT sensors. Telegraf is written in Go and compiles into a single binary with no external dependencies, and requires a very minimal memory footprint.

### InfluxDB

InfluxDB is the open source time series database that is part of the TICK (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor) stack. It is designed to handle high write and query loads and provides a SQL-like query language called InfluxQL for interacting with data.

### Chronograf

Chronograf is the user interface and administrative component of the InfluxDB 1.x platform. Use templates and libraries to rapidly build dashboards with real-time visualizations.

### Kapacitor

Kapacitor is a native data processing engine for InfluxDB 1.x and is an integrated component in the InfluxDB 2.0 platform. Kapacitor can process both stream and batch data from InfluxDB, acting on this data in real-time via its programming language TICKscript.

### Nginx

NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

### Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
